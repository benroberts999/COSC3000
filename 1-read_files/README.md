# Read text files - examples

* Examples in:
  * python
  * Mathematica
  * C++
  * gnuplot

"data.dat" is a simple white-space delimetered text file, with no comments, and no header.
This is typically the easier format to read in.

"data-csv-labels.dat" is a comma separated file, with column headers, and a data header at the top, which we need to skip/ignore

The python, C++, and gnuplot examples with "extra" will read in the more complicated CSV data
