# COSC3000: Data Visualisation examples

This repository contains examples for the data visualisation + analysis section of the course.
I'll add to it as the semester progresses.

Feel free to comment (or better yet, submit a pull request) if you spot any errors, have a nicer way to do something, or have any other comments/suggestions!

* [00-Basic](./00-Basic/)
  * Some very basic introductory python versions of matlab scripts

## Week 1

* [read-files](./01-week1/read-files/)
  * A number of basic examples showing reading in text files + plotting
  * Examples in: python, C++, gnuplot, matlab, Mathematica, C
  * See [README-read_files.md](./01-week1/read-files/README-read_files.md) for details

* [binary-files](./01-week1/binary-files/)
  * Examples of reading/writing binary files
  * See [README_binary-files.md](./01-week1/binary-files/README_binary-files.md) for details

* [GPS-example](./01-week1/GPS-example/)
  * A more complicated "real world" example, using skills from above
    * (This will probably be more accessible after a few weeks of the course, but I give it to you now for your interest)
  * Plots public atomic clock data from GPS (provided by JPL/NASA)
  * See [README_GPS-example.md](./01-week1/GPS-example/README_GPS-example.md) for details

* [waveform](./01-week1/waveform)
  * Python and C++ versions of the matlab script to read the binary waveform data from week 1 tutorial

* [proj1-example](./01-week1/proj1-example)
  * A bare-bones python example similar to provided matlab example for first project
