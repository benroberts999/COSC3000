# COSC3000: Data Visualisation examples

This repository contains examples for the data visualisation + analysis section of the course.
I'll add to it as the semester progresses.

Feel free to comment (or better yet, submit a pull request) if you spot any errors, have a nicer way to do something, or have any other comments/suggestions!
